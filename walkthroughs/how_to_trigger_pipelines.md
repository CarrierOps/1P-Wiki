## Other Pipelines
**Note 1** for some other pipelines you will need access to [MAGE](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/TinyTechTidbits/CodeMunchies/hello-mage.md).

**Note 2:** If you need to manually trigger pipelines that are not listed above, please contact Michael or Thomas.

- To see if your pipeline run is successful, on the side navigtion bar of mage go to `pipeline runs`. 
- If you pipeline you triggered have a status of done as seen in the figure above, then the pipeline run has been successful ðŸ˜ƒ. 
- If not, you may have to debug in which you will need to click the logs button beside the status indicator or once again contact Michael or Thomas.
