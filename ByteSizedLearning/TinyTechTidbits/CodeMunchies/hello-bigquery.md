If you click on the arrow beside programs project name, you can see an expanded view of the resources in the project. You can think of these as folders in a traditional file system, but instead of storing files, we are store tables of data. You can further explore what tables and data is in each folder by clicking on the arrow beside each folder as seen in the Exploring ***Tables In BigQuery*** figure.
