# Getting Started With GitHub

## Introduction

### What is Git?
Git is a version control tool that allows you to take snapshots of your files. You can track changes made since the last snapshot track every file in a repository (folder) including subfolders. It always you to develope in parallel using branches (more of this later!). You can connect & save your git repository anywhere (GitHub) and collaborate with others on the same codebase/files.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a place to host our git repositories. It acts as a “Source of Truth” for our codebase. GitHub provides a solution to the following questions.

- How do I share my code with others?
- How do I work on the same code with others?
  
GitHub also provides many additional features such as:

- Security
- User management
- Github actions
- And much much much more!

**Note:** There is a GitHub Desktop application that can be used to perform some of the operations in the next section; however, it is highly recommended to use and get familiar with the command line.


## Common Commands
**Maybe add a screenshot?**

`git clone`: This command allows you to clone a GitHub Repository so that you have the ability to work on a code repository with others and be able to make changes to and receive changes from others.

`git status`: This command shows you any changes that you have made to your current repository such as modifying, adding, or deleting files.

`git add`: This command allows you to specify which which changes you want to add to the repository.

`git commit`: This command is the intermediate step between adding changes and applying changes often accompanied with a message describing what was changed.

`git push`: This command applies the changes made locally on your machine/version of the repository to the repository on GitHub. This allows others to now see those changes access them.

`git pull`: This command gets the latest version of the GitHub repository with all the latest edits and makes sure that your local version has all of those changes.

`git branch`: This command tells you what branch you are currently on in your repository.

`git clean`: This command allows you to remove specific changes or files that you added and do not want to have pushed to GitHub.

`git restore`: This command allows you to restore back to the latest version of the repository that you had by reverting back all changes made. This is very useful for making quick edits to a code for testing purpose but not wanting to have those changes present in the repository.
