## Introduction

### What is Git?
Git is a version control tool that allows you to take snapshots of your files. You can track changes made since the last snapshot track every file in a repository (folder) including subfolders. It always you to develope in parallel using branches(more of this later!). You can connect & save your git repository anywhere (GitHub) and collaborate with others on the same codebase/files.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a place to host our git repositories. It acts as a “Source of Truth” for our codebase. GitHub provides a solution to the following questions.

- How do I share my code with others?
- How do I work on the same code with others?
  
GitHub also provides many additional features such as:

- Security
- User management
- Github actions
- And much much much more!
