# Getting Started With GCP


## What Is The Cloud?
The Cloud is essentially a global network of servers which are connected and operate as a single ecosystem. These servers can provide functions such as storing and managing data (Google Cloud Storage), running applications/services such as BigQuery, along with many other uses.

## Home Screen
When first getting started on GCP, the first thing you will most likely see is the home screen.

Here you can navigate to a variety of different services hosted on the Cloud by clicking on the appropriate box as seen in the diagram above.
**Note**: There are over a 100 services on GCP, but here are the main ones we use.
For further explanations, please click on the following links to get a more comprehensive understanding of the services.

- [BigQuery](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/TinyTechTidbits/CodeMunchies/hello-bigquery.md): The Data Warehouse hosted on GCP.


- [Google Cloud Storage](): The Data Lake hosted on GCP.

- [Pub Sub](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/pubsub.md): The messaging service hosted on GCP.

- [IAM And Admin](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/IAM.md): The service used to manage users and manage access to everything in GCP.

- [Cloud Run](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/Cloud-Run.md): Allows you to run your code directly on top of Googleâ€™s scalable infrastructure.
  
- [Cloud Functions](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/Cloud-Functions.md): This allows you to run code/function in the cloud.
