# Command line

We all know that computer are just machines that only understand 0s and 1s. So then how come you can do things on your computer through a nifty graphical user interface (GUI) - how come you can use your mouse to open programs and do things and instead of having to type in a series of 0s and 1s?

The answer lies in the various layers of abstraction that exist between the binary zeros and ones and the GUIs. These layers translate our interactions into instructions that the computer's hardware can execute. Among these layers, one of the most pivotal is the command line interface (CLI).

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based platform through which users input commands directly into a terminal, offering a more straightforward path to the computer's operating system compared to the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) most are familiar with. The CLI might initially appear less approachable than the GUI's visual navigation, but it grants users significantly greater control over their computer's operations.

Unlike the GUI, which simplifies interaction by visualizing the computer's file system and applications, the CLI demands an understanding of specific commands. This requirement, though it may seem like a barrier, is actually a gateway to more efficient computer use. Through the CLI, tasks that might take several steps in a GUI can often be executed swiftly with a single command.

The list of commands you can run will depend entirely on your operating system, and commands from one OS to the next may be widely different (think windows vs linux).

This tutorial will highlight some basic and useful command for the Windows command prompt, as well as some linux commands.
