## What Are Cloud Functions?
Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services [Source](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/overview). Cloud functions allows you to write functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services [Source](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/overview). These events can be triggered by changes in data, new messages, user interactions, or other predefined events within your cloud infrastructure and services. Cloud Functions allow you to easily run scripts on the cloud using a variety of popular coding languages such as Python and R. For further details on Cloud Functions and how to use the, please visit the [Official Google Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/overview).
