# What Is Cloud Run?

Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure [Source](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run). Any code can be deployed no matter what the language is so long as you can build a container from it. For information on containers, visit the [Docker Section](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/Docker.md).
