# What Is Cloud Run?

Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure [Source](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run). It is [serverless](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/TinyTechTidbits/server-vs-serverless.md). Any code can be deployed no matter what the language is so long as you can build a container from it. For information on containers, visit the [Docker Section](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/Docker.md). To read more about Cloud Run, please visit the [Offical Google Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/overview/what-is-cloud-run)

To compare to a VM, a VM is like renting an entire apartment when you might just need one room. It comes with the operating system and gives you full control, but it also requires you to manage and maintain it, like doing your own repairs and paying for all the utilities, even if you don't use them all the time. On the other hand, using Cloud Run is like renting just enough space for your needs (the container), with the landlord (Google) taking care of utilities, repairs, and security at a scale.
