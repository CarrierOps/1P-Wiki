# Artifact Registry

Artifact registry is a place that stores [Docker](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/Docker.md) images as well as packages for programming languages. We use it to store Docker Images that we created to run services on Cloud Run, and to house any custom python libraries we may want to develop.

Artifact Registry works by using repositories (akin to [GitHub](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/Description%20Of%20Services/GitHub.md) repositories) which are top-level folders that hold images/packages.
