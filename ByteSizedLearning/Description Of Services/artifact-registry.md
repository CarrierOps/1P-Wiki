# Artifact Registry

Artifact registry is a place that stores Docker images as well as packages for programming languages. We use it to store Docker Images we created to run services on Cloud Run, and to house any custom python libraries we may want to develop.

Artifact Registry works by using repositories (akin to GitHub repositories) which are top-level folders that hold images/packages.
