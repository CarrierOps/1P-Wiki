# BigQuery Structure

BigQuery is the star of the show. It is where all data used for reporting, dashboard, analytics, etc is stored. It is where all raw data ends up after being cleaned, refined, aggregated, transformed, and modeled.

It houses silver, gold, and platinum layer data. You can [check out this documentation](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/ByteSizedLearning/TinyTechTidbits/data-layer.md) for more details on the different layers of data.
