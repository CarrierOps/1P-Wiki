# Pub/Sub documentation

## Overview

Pubsub is used heavily in the backend of our infrastructure on GCP, most notably as a way to make things event-driven. For a more in-depth explanation of how Pub/Sub works, [check out this documentation](https://github.com/CarrierOps/1P-Wiki/blob/main/wiki/Description%20Of%20Services/pubsub.md) Of Services/pubsub.md

## List of Resources

This list will list out all Pub/Sub topics & their subscribers. Top-level bulltet points will be Pub?Sub topics. Some Pub/Sub topics & subribers names are auto-generated by GCP, the abbreviated name will will be written down & the full name will be written in parentheses beside it.
